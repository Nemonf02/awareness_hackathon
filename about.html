      <h3>Who Are the Uighurs?</h3>
      <p>The Uighurs are a Turkic ethnic group whose members are predominantly Muslim. Uighurs have a distinct culture and history, including the declaration of two short-lived independent republics, both known as East Turkestan, in the first half of the 20th century.</p>

       <p>Nearly 11 million Uighurs live in Xinjiang in the far northwest of China, an arid region of mountains and expansive steppes. Smaller groups are found across Central Asia. Scholars say Uighur identity developed over centuries around oasis towns.</p>

        <h3>What’s Actually Happening To Uighur Muslims In China?</h3>
        <p>The chiniese government is persecuting Uighur Muslims and forcing them into ‘re-education’ concentration camps, where they have been forced to eat pork and children have been separated from their families with the intention that they grow up not learning about Islam. In addition to all of this, the BBC recently reported that US Customs and Border Protection at the port of New York and New Jersey seized a 13-ton shipment of hair products worth than $800,000 of Uighur Muslim women’s hair, made by forced labour from children or prisoners of the camps. They are destroying masjids (muslim place of worship) or turning them into bars where they sell alcohol.  </p>

        <h3>Why is the Chinese government persecuting Uighurs?</h3>
        <p>China says that the crackdown is necessary to prevent terrorism and root out Islamic extremism. The action is part of a larger campaign by Chinese leader Xi Jinping to promote Han nationalism as a unifying force – the Han are China’s ethnic majority – and to suppress any ethnic, cultural or religious identities that might compete for popular loyalty with the Chinese Communist Party.</p>

        <h3>What does China say about the camps?</h3>
        <p>In a statement to ICIJ’s media partner The Guardian, China said the camps are an effective tool in its fight against terrorism and do not infringe on religious liberty.

            “Since the measures have been taken, there’s no single terrorist incident in the past three years. Xinjiang again turns into a prosperous, beautiful and peaceful region,” according to the statement, issued by the press office of China’s embassy to the United Kingdom. “The preventative measures have nothing to do with the eradication of religious groups. Religious freedom is fully respected in Xinjiang.” </p>
